      <p class="p"> My name is Marshall Peele. I was born in Washington DC in 1992 at Washington Hospital Center. I attended School Without Walls (yes this a real school) and graduated in 2010.
      My favorite thing to study was history, my father is a huge history buff and I defintely got it from him. We enjoy discussing anything to do with 
      World War 2. I have one brother named Miles who is a software developer. My friends and families would call me friendly and hilarious.
      I like video games and going for a jog. I hope to make it out to the beach this summer to show off my bod! I really like football
      My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys also known as America's Team. </p>
